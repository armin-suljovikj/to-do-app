# to-do-app
Hi everyone!

This is my first ever published React app and it's a to-do list. 

# Description
A simple all which allows you to add tasks and remove them from a list

# Features used
The app was built mainly using functional components and hooks, also using the following libraries:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify
- https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome
- https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move]

# The published To-do App:

# Credits
Credits go to @abarna1908, mainly for instructions on how to build this. In the original code class components are used, but I re-built the app using Hooks.
